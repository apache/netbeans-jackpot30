# Apache NetBeans Standalone Java Hints

This tool allows to run NetBeans Java code checker without the NetBeans IDE. This includes running the custom Java hints specified in META-INF/upgrade/*.hint.

### Requirements

#### To Build

* Apache NetBeans 12.4
* JDK 8 and JDK 11
* bash
* Apache ant 1.9.9 or above
* Apache Maven 3.3.9 or above

#### To Run

* JDK 11

### Building

Build using:

```
$ ant -DNETBEANS_PLATFORM=<path-to-NetBeans-12.4> -DJDK11=<path-to-JDK-11> build-and-test
```

The built product is in tool/build/jackpot.

### Running

Run using:

```
$ jackpot <options> <files-to-inspect>
```

To get help on the options, run:

```
$ jackpot --help
```

### Example

Consider this sample code:

```
package test;

public class Test {
    public void test(boolean b) {
        int i = 0;
        if (b)
            System.err.println("was true");
            assert (i = 1) == 1;
    }
}
```

It is possible to get a warning for the improper indentation like this:
```
$ jackpot --hint "Confusing indentation" <somedir>/src
<somedir>/src/test/Test.java:9: warning: [Confusing_indentation] Confusing indentation
            assert (i = 1) == 1;
            ^
```

Or a warning for the side-effects inside the assert:
```
$ jackpot --hint "Assert with side effects" <somedir>/src
<somedir>/src/test/Test.java:9: warning: [Assert_with_side_effects] Assert condition produces side effects
            assert (i = 1) == 1;
                    ^
```

All supported hints can be listed using:
```
$ jackpot --list
```

It is also possible to use a configuration file which enables multiple hints at once using:
```
$ jackpot --config-file <path-to-config-file> <path-to-sources-to-check>
```

The config file can be generated by the NetBeans IDE, using Project Properties/Hints, or similar ways.
